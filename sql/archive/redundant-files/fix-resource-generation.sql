-- Fix for automatic resource generation issue
-- This script fixes the UpdateResources database event that was failing due to SQL syntax issues
-- The original event had table aliasing conflicts that caused MySQL errors

USE browsergame;

-- Drop existing event if it exists
DROP EVENT IF EXISTS UpdateResources;

-- Create working UpdateResources event using cursor-based approach
-- This event runs every second and adds resources based on building production rates
-- Resources are capped at the storage capacity from the highest level Lager building

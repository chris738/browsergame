# SQL Fix Integration Summary

This document summarizes the integration of all fix-*.sql files into the main SQL structure.

## What was changed

All separate fix files (fix.sql, fix-*.sql) have been integrated into the organized SQL structure. The database now works correctly from initial setup without needing separate fix applications.

## Integrated Fixes

### 1. Building Level Fix (from fix-building-unlock-bug.sql)
- **Files updated**: `tables/core_tables.sql`, `database.sql`
- **Change**: Buildings table default level changed from 1 to 0
- **Purpose**: Market and Barracks should unlock at level 0 when requirements are met

### 2. Process Building Queue Fix (from fix-process-building-queue.sql)
- **Files updated**: `database.sql`
- **Change**: ProcessBuildingQueue event now handles new building creation properly
- **Purpose**: Prevents level 5 reset bug by creating Buildings entries for new constructions

### 3. Upgrade Building Procedure Fix (from fix-upgrade-building.sql)
- **Files updated**: `procedures/building_procedures.sql`, `database.sql`
- **Change**: UpgradeBuilding procedure uses COALESCE(level, 0) for missing buildings
- **Purpose**: Handles upgrading buildings that don't exist yet (start at level 0)

### 4. Military Settler Costs (from fix-military-settlers.sql)
- **Files updated**: `tables/core_tables.sql`, `procedures/building_procedures.sql`, `data/initial_data.sql`, `database.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added MilitarySettlerCosts table
  - Added costSettlers column to MilitaryUnitConfig
  - Added TrainMilitaryUnit procedure with settler cost tracking
- **Purpose**: Proper settler cost management for military units

### 5. Settlement Settlers View Fix (from fix-resources-settlers.sql)
- **Files updated**: `views/game_views.sql`, `database.sql`
- **Change**: SettlementSettlers view now provides base 100 settlers for new settlements
- **Purpose**: Ensures new settlements have proper base settler capacity

### 6. Starting Buildings Fix (from fix-starting-buildings.sql)
- **Files updated**: `procedures/player_procedures.sql`, `database.sql`
- **Change**: CreatePlayerWithSettlement only creates essential starting buildings
- **Purpose**: Market and Barracks are created on-demand when requirements are met

### 7. Extended Building Configurations (from fix.sql)
- **Files updated**: `data/initial_data.sql`, `database.sql`
- **Change**: All building types now have configurations for levels 1-10
- **Purpose**: Prevents config lookup failures when buildings reach higher levels

### 8. Event Scheduler Setup
- **Files updated**: `database.sql`
- **Change**: Ensures event scheduler is enabled and all events are active
- **Purpose**: Automatic processing of building queues, resource updates, etc.

## Files Removed

The following fix files have been removed as their functionality is now integrated:
- `fix.sql` - Comprehensive level 5 reset bug fix
- `fix-building-unlock-bug.sql` - Building unlock fix
- `fix-military-settlers.sql` - Military unit settler cost fix
- `fix-process-building-queue.sql` - Building queue processing fix
- `fix-resources-settlers.sql` - Resource and settler calculation fix
- `fix-starting-buildings.sql` - Starting buildings fix
- `fix-upgrade-building.sql` - Building upgrade procedure fix

## Database Schema Manager Update

`php/database/schema/DatabaseSchemaManager.php` has been updated to remove references to fix files since all fixes are now integrated into the main schema.

## How to use

Simply run the database initialization as normal:
- Use `scripts/rebuild-database.sh` to rebuild the database
- All fixes are automatically applied as part of the main schema
- No separate fix application is needed

## Testing

The integration has been validated to ensure:
- All key fixes are present in the main SQL files
- No syntax errors in SQL or PHP files
- Script tests pass
- No remaining references to fix files in code or scripts

The database now provides a complete, working solution without dependency on separate fix files.

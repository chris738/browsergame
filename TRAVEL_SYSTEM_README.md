# Travel Time System

This document describes the travel time system implementation for the browsergame. The system adds realistic travel times for military attacks and resource trades based on distance between settlements.

## Overview

### Key Features

- **Travel Times for Attacks**: Military units now take time to travel between settlements (2-10 seconds per block distance)
- **Travel Times for Trades**: Resource trades require travel time (configurable, default 5 seconds per block)
- **Configurable Speed**: Different military units have different travel speeds
- **Configurable Loot**: Military units have configurable resource theft amounts
- **Admin Panel**: Complete administrative interface for managing all settings
- **Real-time Tracking**: Players can see their armies and trades in transit with countdown timers

## System Components

### Database Tables

- **`TravelConfig`**: Stores base travel speeds for different travel types
- **`TravelingArmies`**: Tracks military units in transit for attacks
- **`TravelingTrades`**: Tracks resource shipments in transit
- **`TravelHistory`**: Archives completed travels for statistics
- **`MilitaryUnitConfig`**: Extended with `speed` and `lootAmount` fields

### PHP Components

- **`TravelRepository`**: Handles all travel-related database operations
- **`ProcessTravelArrivals` Event**: MySQL event for automated processing of arrivals (every 5 seconds)
- **`admin-travel.php`**: Admin interface for managing travel settings

### Database Events

- **`ProcessTravelArrivals`**: Automatically processes army and trade arrivals every 5 seconds
- **Travel Procedures**: Stored procedures handle battle calculations and trade deliveries

### Frontend Updates

- **Battle Interface**: Shows traveling armies with real-time countdowns
- **Market Interface**: Shows traveling trades with progress tracking
- **Admin Panel**: Complete configuration interface

## Installation

### 1. Database Setup

The travel system is automatically set up when using Docker Compose as described in the main README.

For manual setup, run the SQL files:

```bash
mysql -u browsergame -p browsergame < sql/tables/travel_tables.sql
mysql -u browsergame -p browsergame < sql/data/military_travel_data.sql
```

### 2. Event System

The travel system uses MySQL events for automated processing, similar to the building queue system. The `ProcessTravelArrivals` event runs every 5 seconds and automatically processes:

- Army arrivals (executing battles and returning survivors)
- Trade arrivals (delivering resources)

No additional setup is required - events are automatically enabled during database initialization.

### 3. Verify the Installation

The travel system is integrated into the main game interface. You can verify it's working by:

1. Creating a settlement if none exists
2. Training military units in the barracks
3. Attempting an attack to see travel times in action
4. Using the market to test trade travel times

**Note**: Legacy standalone test files have been moved to `archive/standalone-tests/` for reference but are no longer needed for normal operation.

## Configuration

### Admin Panel

Access the admin panel at `admin-travel.php` to configure:

1. **Travel Speeds**
   - Trade travel speed (seconds per block)
   - Military base speed (seconds per block)

2. **Military Unit Configuration**
   - Individual unit speeds (2-10 seconds per block)
   - Loot amounts (resources units can carry)
   - Attack and defense powers

3. **System Monitoring**
   - View all traveling armies
   - View all traveling trades
   - Manual arrival processing

### Default Configuration

**Military Unit Speeds** (seconds per block):
- Guards: 8 seconds (slowest, most defensive)
- Soldiers: 6 seconds (balanced)
- Archers: 4 seconds (fast)
- Cavalry: 2 seconds (fastest)

**Loot Amounts** (resources per unit):
- Guards: 5.0
- Soldiers: 10.0
- Archers: 8.0
- Cavalry: 20.0

**Trade Speed**: 5 seconds per block

## How It Works

### Attack Process

1. Player selects target and units for attack
2. System calculates distance between settlements
3. Determines travel time based on slowest unit's speed
4. Units are removed from attacking settlement immediately
5. Travel record is created with arrival time
6. When cron job processes arrival, battle is executed
7. Surviving units are returned to attacking settlement
8. Resources are plundered based on unit loot capacity

### Trade Process

1. Player accepts a trade offer
2. Resources are removed from both players immediately
3. Two travel records are created (one for each direction)
4. When cron job processes arrivals, resources are delivered
5. Trade is marked as completed

### Distance Calculation

Distance is calculated using Euclidean distance between settlement coordinates:
```
distance = √((x₁ - x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²)
```

Minimum distance is 1 block (for same settlement trades/attacks).

## API Endpoints

### Battle Endpoints

- `GET php/battle-backend.php?action=getTravelingArmies&settlementId=X`
- `POST php/battle-backend.php` with `action=attack` (now starts travel)

### Market Endpoints

- `GET php/market-backend.php?getTravelingTrades=true&settlementId=X`
- `POST php/market-backend.php` with `action=acceptOffer` (now starts travel)

### Admin Endpoints

- `GET php/admin-backend.php?action=getTravelConfig`
- `GET php/admin-backend.php?action=getMilitaryUnitConfig`
- `GET php/admin-backend.php?action=getAllTravelingArmies`
- `GET php/admin-backend.php?action=getAllTravelingTrades`
- `POST php/admin-backend.php` with `action=updateTravelConfig`
- `POST php/admin-backend.php` with `action=updateMilitaryUnitConfig`
- `POST php/admin-backend.php` with `action=processArrivals`

## Performance Considerations

### Event Processing

The system uses MySQL events to process arrivals every 5 seconds, providing optimal responsiveness while maintaining system efficiency.

### Database Optimization

The system automatically processes arrivals via database events. Consider adding these optimizations:

1. **Index Optimization**: Ensure proper indexes on arrival times
2. **Archive Old Data**: Move old travel history to archive tables
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch query execution times during peak usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Events Not Running**
   - Check event scheduler: `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler'`
   - Enable if needed: `SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON`
   - Check event status in admin panel

2. **Arrivals Not Processing**
   - Run manual processing via admin panel or: `CALL ProcessAllArrivals()`
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify arrival times in database
   - Check if ProcessTravelArrivals event is enabled

3. **Frontend Not Updating**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Clear browser cache

### Event System Debugging

- **Check Event Status**: Use the admin panel's "Check Event Status" button
- **Manual Processing**: Use "Process All Arrivals Now" button for testing
- **Database Events**: Query `information_schema.EVENTS` for event status

### Logs

- **PHP Errors**: Check server error logs
- **Database Errors**: Check MySQL error logs
- **Event Execution**: Check MySQL general log for event execution

## Security Considerations

1. **Validation**: All travel requests are validated for unit availability
2. **Authentication**: Admin endpoints require proper authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limits for frequent API calls
4. **Resource Limits**: Travel capacity is limited by unit availability

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the travel system:

1. **Unit Groups**: Allow sending multiple unit types with different speeds
2. **Waypoints**: Enable multi-stop journeys
3. **Terrain Effects**: Different terrain types affect travel speed
4. **Weather System**: Weather conditions impact travel times
5. **Supply Lines**: Require supply management for long journeys
6. **Battle Formations**: Unit formation affects travel and combat
7. **Notifications**: Email/SMS alerts for important arrivals
8. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile interface for travel management
